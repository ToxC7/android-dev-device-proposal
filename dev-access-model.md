# Developer Access Model

This document outlines the eligibility, verification process, and responsibilities required to obtain and use a **Dev-Certified Android Device**.

---

## ✅ Who Qualifies?

To apply for a Dev-Certified device, you must prove that you are a legitimate Android developer, researcher, or modder. Examples include:

- Android kernel or recovery maintainer
- Custom ROM developer (e.g., Lineage, PixelExperience, etc.)
- Security researcher (with CVEs, writeups, or bug bounties)
- Open-source contributor to AOSP or firmware tools
- Academic student, faculty, or hardware developer

---

## 📝 Application Requirements

You will need to submit the following:

- Your full name and government/institution-issued ID
- Your GitHub/GitLab or XDA profile
- ROM/kernel/recovery project links, research writeups, or videos
- Signed agreement to the developer legal waiver
- Optional: links to presentations, CTF profiles, blogs, or demo videos

---

## 🔐 Firmware Security & Controls

- 🔒 Each firmware is **digitally watermarked** per developer
- 📌 Bound to your device ID and developer identity
- 🚫 Unauthorized sharing or public posting is a **serious violation**
- 🧠 Designed to detect firmware leaks and revoke access remotely
- 📦 Developer firmware is **not OTA-compatible** with consumer builds

---

## ❌ Disqualifying Actions

- Submitting fake, stolen, or AI-generated projects
- Attempting to remove or spoof firmware watermarks
- Distributing firmware, dev tools, or system images publicly
- Using the firmware to:
  - Inject spyware or malware
  - Evade DRM, banking security, or privacy laws
  - Damage third-party networks or services

---

## 📛 Device Boot Warning (Example)

WARNING: This is a Dev-Certified Android Device
Root: ENABLED | Verified Boot: OFF
Support: LIMITED | Use at your own risk


This warning appears on every boot to inform the user and discourage resale.

---

## ⚠️ Your Responsibilities

By requesting and using a Dev-Certified Android Device, you agree:

- You fully understand the risk of root access, firmware changes, and irreversible modifications
- You will not hold OEMs, Google, or any maintainers legally liable for issues
- You are personally responsible for any misuse or data loss
- You will not leak firmware, bypass access control, or damage the reputation of this developer ecosystem

This access model is designed to support real developers, not power abusers. Our goal is ethical innovation — not evasion.
