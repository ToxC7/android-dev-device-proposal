Dev-Certified Android Device Proposal

A new class of Android phones made specifically for developers, ROM builders, and ethical hackers.

These devices come with official root access, an unlocked bootloader, 15 years of support, and legal waivers — so you don't need to hide from Play Integrity or risk warranty fights.

✅ Official root access  
✅ Developer-only firmware tied to identity  
✅ Legal agreement required  
✅ Higher price to prevent casual misuse  
✅ Long-term support (15+ years)  
✅ Strict anti-leak licensing

Built for real development — not casual risk.
